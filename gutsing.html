            Guts is the main protagonist of Berserk. Also known as the Black Swordsman, Guts is a
            former mercenary and member of the Band of Falcão, currently a traveler with the mark of the sacrifice in which
            He travels the world in constant conflict between achieving his goals and looking after those close to him.
        </p>
        <h1>
            APPEARANCE
        </h1>
        <p>
            Guts is a tall man with a muscular physique and short, pointed black hair. On your forehead,
            some strands hang low, falling over your forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
            He wears bandages over his right hand (a style he has used since the beginning, probably for the
            help handle the sword) and wears a white sleeveless shirt, allowing him to move his arms
            freely.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his pants there is also a set of armor in the groin area, probably to protect him.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            During the Golden Age, Guts wears a brown set of armor that transitions between leather and a darker material.
            hard. In addition to this equipment, he is usually seen in battle wearing a uniquely shaped helmet, the
            which protects its entire head, with the exception of its mouth. He later discards his helmet as he exits the
            Falcons (along with the sword he had been using up until that point, due to it being broken in battle
            by Boscogne).
        </p>

            <figcaption>
                Guts with his initial armor
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            In the Punishment Saga, Guts is portrayed as a man wearing a long black cape with a hood over his head. He
            is portrayed as a very tall man, 190cm, with a strong muscular structure and full of scars.
            In one scene, he is shown killing 69 men (more if you include the background screams. A soldier comments
            that "there must be more than 100 corpses."). Although he appears to be in his thirties at first glance, he possesses
            actually only twenty years old at this point and has been hardened by a lifetime of war.w
        </p>
        <p>
            Without his hood, he is shown to be a man with a young, unwrinkled face, with a scar
            through your nose. His right eye remains closed at all times, it is later revealed that he
            it was removed by an Apostle some time before. Guts was forced to cut his arm off because he couldn't
            he could free his arm from a creature's teeth. His left arm was cut off just below the
            elbow, having been replaced by the Cannon Arm equipped with a cannon and a magnet in the part of the palm capable of
            of holding the enormous blade he carries with him. His outfit consists of a long black armor.
            complete with dark pants and armored boots.

        <p>
            Guts' armor is improved in the Millennium Falcon Saga by Rickert, making his plates have
            close resemblance to the Berserker armor he would later wear.

        <p>
            Shortly after the battle against Slan, and later against Grunbeld, Guts switches from his normal armor to
            Berserker Armor. The first use of the armor caused the Dark Beast to shape the armor,
            turning a part of her black hair white.

        <h1>
            PERSONALITY
        </h1>
        <p>
            Guts has what could be the most complex personality in the entire series. It can be said that due to this
            complex personality, he is perhaps the most "human" of the characters introduced, demonstrating changes
            significant changes to the character as he ages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been born into a bloody situation and forced into a life of violence, Guts barely had time to
            live like a normal child. Although he experienced moments of happiness and joy, his true
            passion was warped into a desire for fighting, mainly to gain Gambino's acceptance and later
            to enhance your own combat skills. After successfully killing the first person in what
            would become a list of thousands, Guts trained himself to become stronger and know how to hold his
            sword, eventually creating a strong and very personal relationship with the blade he wields.
        </p>
        <p>
            During his time with the Band of the Hawk, Guts had also told Casca that he was only happy when wielding his sword.
