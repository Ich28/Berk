            Berserk (ベルセルク Beruseruku?) is a manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a world
            Dark fantasy inspired by medieval Europe, the story revolves around Guts, a lonely mercenary,
            and Griffith, the leader of a band of mercenaries called the "Falcon Band". Miura published a one-shot by
            Berserk in 1988. The series began to have its chapters published the following year in the now defunct magazine
            Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the bimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk continues
            to be serialized intermittently. Miura passed away in May 2021, the final chapter he wrote and
            illustrated was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under the
            supervision by Miura's colleague and childhood friend, Kouji Mori, and the group of assistants and apprentices
            Miura from Studio Gaga.

            The work is divided into two main "parts": The Golden Age and The Dark Age

                    The Golden Age is the period that focuses on telling Guts' past before he became a swordsman.
                    black, in other words, it can be considered a "prequel" to BERSERK. His arc of the same name is the most
                    prominent feature of Berserk, having been adapted as both an anime series and a trilogy
                    of films.

                <p>
                    It extends from chapter 9-94, having a total of 102 chapters in that period.

                    The Dark Age is the period where most of the story takes place, with the Eclipse already having
                    happened and Guts wanders around seeking revenge. Unlike the Gilded Age, this period did not have as many
                    adaptations, only BERSERK: 2016-17 and BERSERK: BLACK SWORDSMAN
                </p>
                <p>
                    It extends from chapters 1-8, continuing from 95 to the present.
