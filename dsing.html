            "It was too big to be called a sword. Huge, thick, heavy and rough. It looks more like a
            giant hunk of iron."<br>

            The Dragon Slayer is the enormous sword that Guts has wielded as his signature weapon since surviving the
            Eclipse, was forged by the blacksmith Godot, who at the time had been ordered to create a sword capable of
            to kill a dragon.

        <p>
            It was kept in storage for years until it was discovered by Guts during a fight against a
            unidentified wandering apostle, where the Black Swordsman wields it with ease and kills the apostle in
            two blows, shocking Godot, who thought the sword's weight made it unusable as a weapon.
            Subsequently, embarking on a war against the demons, Guts makes effective use of the Dragon Slayer against
            evil spirits, possessed monsters, and particularly apostles. When Guts returns to his house,
            Godot two years later, Godot sees the wear and tear that the Dragon Slayer has suffered and decides to reform her.

            ABILITIES
        </h1>
        <p> Given the sword's incredible size and weight, the Dragon Slayer functions more like a bladed war sledgehammer.
            than as a
            real sword, although Guts is more than capable of using it to slash multiple targets. The simple impulse to
            Guts swinging it can shatter anyone caught in the impact of the attack with a single hit; this usually
            is applied to more than one enemy at the same time, piercing multiple enemies in a single hit. Even the
            Apostles in their true forms can barely face the sword and often have their bones and organs
            internals seriously damaged by a weapon attack. This size and weight also give the Dragon Slayer
            some versatility, as Guts used the weapon's broad side to crush and flatten multiple opponents. A
            The Dragon Slayer's width also allows Guts to use it defensively, as if it were a shield.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Guts activates the Berserker Armor, his resulting inhuman physique and ferocity allows him to
            he uses Dragon Slayer to significantly greater effect. Standard apostles are killed in a matter of
            seconds, and other even larger enemies are eliminated just as easily, sometimes en masse. With
            so much superhuman strength behind him, the Dragon Slayer's cutting power becomes considerable; although
            wielded by a Furious Guts, is capable of breaking through the fire-repelling shield of Grunbeld's cannon, and
            even the skin of his true dragon-apostle form, which is considered stronger than the
            steel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it was used to kill countless apostles, pseudo-apostles and other astral entities
            malevolent, the Dragon Slayer was tempered by the malice of such beings. As a result, the sword became more
            effective against monsters and evil spirits, capable of harming even powerful entities such as the Sea God and
            the corporeal forms of the members of the Hand of God.
