            Griffith is the current leader of the reborn Band of the Falcon and supreme commander of the Midland Regular Army.
            Having been at the forefront of many battles, he has accumulated a reputation as a savior across the continent and is
            Revered as the “Falcon of Light”.
        </p>
        <p>
            As leader of the original Band of the Falcon, he and his mercenaries are able to end the War of the Hundred
            Years and bring peace to the war-torn kingdom of Midland. After the defection of his closest confidant,
            trust, Guts, Griffith takes Princess Charlotte to bed on impulse, causing her arrest, a
            paralyzing torture that lasts a year and the apparent end of his dream. Although he is eventually rescued
            by the band, his state of extreme disability and eternal desire to obtain his own kingdom force him to
            sacrifice his comrades during the fifth Eclipse, out of kinship with the God Hand as his fifth member,
            Femto - an idealized demonic version of himself, stripped of his human inhibitions. Over time, he incarnates
            in the Physical World, concerned only with the realization of his dream, which comes true with the frustration of
            Kushan invasion of Midland, the Great Roar of the Astral World it provokes, and the rise of their utopian
            capital, Falconia.

            Griffith is of average height and has an athletic muscular build, with a somewhat pale skin tone. He has
            white, curly hair (often seen straight in the anime) and blue eyes. He is distinguished by being a
            very handsome man, and has feminine characteristics that many say surpass those of women, while
            some can hardly say he is a man.

        <h1>
            PERSONALITY
        </h1>
        <p>
            Griffith has continually focused on his goal of achieving his dream of obtaining his own kingdom, willing
            to sacrifice everything to achieve it. From birth he always "knew the way up", which gave him
            allowed him to command several soldiers with his charismatic ability. He identifies strongly with his
            dream, so much so that he built his entire identity around it. His selfishness was aggravated by his own
            charisma, and the fact that everyone he met was fascinated by him, whether as a divine leader or a
            powerful enemy, made him isolate himself from others and his own feelings. Griffith was so enchanted
            With his idealized personality he couldn't deal with loss very well. In fact, one of the
            Griffith's greatest burdens was the guilt inflicted on him by the comrades who died for him. Us
            In the early days of the Gaviões, he found the corpse of a child soldier who had served under him, and he
            was so deeply affected by this that he prostituted himself to a perverted Baron to get
            rapid funding in order to avoid the risk of further unnecessary deaths in other battles. A
            The experience deeply traumatized him, so he isolated himself from his companions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although he denied it, never having considered his allies as friends, he considered Guts as his
            dear friend, rather than a pawn for your goals. These feelings bordered on passion, to the point of
            Griffith risked his own life to protect Guts, while trusting him to be his killer, with
            the option to decline. But when Guts left the Falcons, deeply distressed by Guts' actions, it
            broke Griffith, as he fell into depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            After his transformation into Femto, Griffith completely discarded his morals, now only existing
            to realize your dream, together with the collective will of humanity. Griffith demonstrated great cruelty
            upon becoming Femto, his first act after becoming a member of the God Hand being to sexually violate
            Casca and fining her unborn child with his seed, as an act of revenge against Guts, for
            drop you off.
