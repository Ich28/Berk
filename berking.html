            The Berserker Armor is an extremely resistant armor currently used by Guts. Users of this
            armor are aptly called "berserkers", due to the superhuman strength and ferocity they possess.
            is granted to them.

        <p>
            Its main function is, through its od, to suppress the physiological and subconscious systems of the body
            human force that would normally prevent a person from exerting sufficient force to
            hurt. The result is a significant enhancement to the user's physique, increasing their strength and
            speed to previously unimaginable levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The armor does this by eliminating the suffering caused by
            pain; the user may still feel the pain as a sensation, but the mind does not interpret the pain as a problem,
            allowing it to simply be ignored. It also invokes tremendous bloodlust in the user,
            amplifying negative emotions such as hatred, fear and anger which allow the user to fight harder. The armor also
            Temporarily repairs debilitating injuries in the heat of battle. For example, a broken arm will be
            mended the armor by injecting thin thorns into the broken bones and setting them in place, and if the
            armor
            It can also repair itself if it is damaged. Furthermore, Guts noticed while
            ventured into the abode of the Sea God that the activated armor improved his night vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            When inducing uncontrollable rage, the armor's helmet takes on a distinctive appearance. In Guts' case, the
            helmet and barbot take the form of the Beast of Darkness; functioning as a mouth capable of biting
            enemies. When the armor is active, the helmet's eye sockets glow red and the helmet's face glows red.
            Guts
            is completely blocked; If in control of himself, however, the swordsman's face is
            partially visible and the helmet's eye sockets stop emitting their red glow, instead
            showing
            your real eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one case, Berserker Armor displayed the ability to impart to its current user a "memory of
            blood" from a previous user's final moments.
        </p>
        <h1>
            DRAWBACKS
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Armor power comes with significant drawbacks, the most important of which is associated with the od
            which gives the armor its power. If the user does not actively check their negative emotions, the od may
            consume the user's psyche, transforming them into a savage, bloodthirsty monster that can no longer
            differentiate between friend and enemy. If this state is entered repeatedly, the user's senses
            will begin to deteriorate until they are lost completely. Specifically, vision and taste are
            noticed to be affected along with the user potentially developing a hand tremor. He
            can also cause chronic mental deterioration by providing a hotbed for the inner darkness of your
            user to rot. In Guts' case, the only currently reliable way to keep him stable while
            uses the armor to its full effect is to reinforce your mind and spirit with a powerful magical presence, such as the
            exuded by Schierke's astral body or the presence of the Moonlight Boy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The armor's ability to suppress pain allows the wearer to injure themselves through excessive exertion.
            In the same vein, reinforcing armor from broken bones or other debilitating injuries can lead to
            death from blood loss.
